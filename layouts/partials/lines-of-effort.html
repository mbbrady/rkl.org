          <h4>Open Protocols</h4>
          <p>
            Apply and refine public-interest protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for secure AI–knowledge interaction.
            We help define how reasoning systems can interact securely and verifiably with governed knowledge domains—ensuring privacy, provenance, and organizational control.

          <h4>Reference Toolkits</h4>
          <p>
            Build open-source adapters, audit logging, and reproducible on-premises stacks organizations can deploy.
            Our reference implementations demonstrate practical examples of secure AI integration that others can adapt, deploy, and audit.

          <h4>Field Pilots</h4>
          <p>
            Partner with organizations to deploy real-world systems that bridge research and institutional knowledge.
            Through applied pilots—from marine science to municipal planning—we validate practical, secure AI integration.
