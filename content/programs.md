## Core Programs

Resonant Knowledge Lab provides open infrastructure for responsible human-machine reasoning through six interconnected program areas:

---

### Open Protocols for Contextual AI {#open-protocols}

We apply and refine public-interest protocols for verifiable AI–data interaction.

**Focus**: Implementing and advancing open standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) that define how reasoning systems interact securely with governed knowledge domains.

**Activities**:
- Apply MCP to real-world deployment scenarios
- Develop policy-aware retrieval architectures (RAG+)
- Document best practices for protocol-based AI governance
- Contribute to emerging standards discussions as work matures

**Deliverables**:
- MCP implementation patterns and reference architectures
- Protocol extension proposals for domain-specific needs
- Integration guides for existing systems

---

### Reference Implementations & Toolkits {#implementations}

We build open-source adapters and sandboxes for secure AI integration.

**Focus**: Creating reproducible infrastructure that organizations can deploy to connect reasoning systems with their curated knowledge domains.

**Activities**:
- Develop MCP service nodes for common use cases
- Build audit logging and provenance tracking systems
- Create reproducible on-premises deployment stacks
- Maintain open-source repositories with documentation

**Deliverables**:
- MCP + Closed RAG Reference Stack (Year 1 priority)
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment templates
- Audit and compliance tooling
- Integration libraries for Python, JavaScript, and other languages

---

### Decision Support & Knowledge Access Pilots {#pilots}

We partner with organizations to deploy real-world systems enabling natural-language reasoning within trusted data environments.

**Focus**: Applied projects that help practitioners access both current authoritative research and institutional knowledge to support critical decisions.

**Example Use Cases**:

**Healthcare**: Clinicians reasoning with EHR data + peer-reviewed literature without PHI exposure
- MCP-based gateway to electronic health records
- Scoped retrieval with on-premises auditing
- Integration of current medical research

**Public Administration**: Municipal planners using historic records + policy databases
- Policy-aware retrieval with auto-redaction
- Context synthesis from distributed archives
- Decision support for land use and resource allocation

**Cultural Heritage**: Archives providing role-based access with consent controls
- Role-gated RAG systems with policy bundles
- Community-governed access to sensitive materials
- Cross-institutional discovery with data sovereignty

**Education & Research**: Researchers accessing institutional repositories + current literature
- Context brokers linking internal knowledge bases
- Continuous updates from peer-reviewed sources
- Auditable knowledge provenance

**Environmental Management**: Regional groups integrating local observations + scientific models
- Federated RAG across distributed datasets
- Local ecological knowledge + regional climate data
- Policy support with community input visible

**Deliverables**:
- Field pilot case study and validation report (Year 1 priority)
- Deployment configurations and lessons learned
- Performance and security benchmarks

---

### Governance & Stewardship Frameworks {#governance}

We publish templates for consent, data licenses, and governance structures for protocolized AI.

**Focus**: Bridging technical implementation with institutional governance, helping organizations define who can access what knowledge under which conditions.

**Activities**:
- Develop community consent templates
- Create institutional data-trust frameworks
- Design policy-based access control patterns
- Document governance decision trees

**Deliverables**:
- AI Governance Starter Kit (Year 1 priority)
- Data licensing templates for AI contexts
- Consent management workflows
- Compliance checklists for regulated sectors

---

### Research & Applied Inquiry {#research}

Through aspirational research partnerships, we study human–machine collaboration and co-knowledge creation.

**Focus**: Understanding when and how reasoning systems can responsibly contribute to knowledge creation and organizational learning.

**Potential Research Areas** (NSF-fundable):
- Experiments on reasoning within governed contexts
- Analysis of AI-supported organizational learning
- Studies of knowledge discovery vs. knowledge verification
- Human factors in natural-language knowledge access

**Approach**: Embedded research within pilot deployments, producing both practical systems and academic contributions.

---

### Education & Public Engagement {#education}

We build capacity through training in ethical AI and knowledge governance.

**Focus**: Helping organizations understand and implement responsible AI-knowledge systems.

**Activities**:
- Workshops on MCP, RAG, and governance frameworks
- Curricula for practitioners and administrators
- Red/blue-team privacy and security labs
- Public talks and symposia

**Deliverables**:
- Training modules and workshop materials
- Online courses and documentation
- Case studies and implementation guides
- Community of practice support

---

## Year 1 Operational Focus (2025–2026)

RKL's first year emphasizes three high-impact deliverables:

1. **MCP + Closed RAG Reference Stack**
   - Reproducible, privacy-preserving AI context environment
   - Demonstrates "trust through protocol" in practice
   - Open GitHub release with full documentation

2. **Field Pilot (Single Partner)**
   - Real-world deployment with archive, clinic, or municipality
   - Validation of technical and governance approaches
   - Public case study + reproducible configurations

3. **Governance Toolkit v1**
   - Templates for consent, licensing, and policy-based access
   - Bridges technical and institutional audiences
   - PDF + Markdown release for broad adoption

These activities provide tangible outcomes for initial funders and establish the foundation for multi-site pilots, fellowships, and the Public-Interest Compute Consortium.

## Illustrative Sector Applications

| Sector | Challenge | RKL Approach | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Healthcare** | Clinicians need GPT/Claude-level reasoning without PHI exposure | MCP gateway to EHR + peer-reviewed sources with on-prem auditing | Clinical decisions informed by both patient data and current research, zero data egress |
| **Public Admin** | Cities must use historic records for planning without exposing sensitive info | Policy-aware retrieval + auto-redaction + context synthesis | Faster, more informed decisions from institutional memory |
| **Cultural Heritage** | Archives need role-based access with consent controls | Role-gated RAGs + community governance policies | Data sovereignty preserved, cross-community insight enabled |
| **Education** | Teachers need current, verified knowledge beyond static materials | Context brokers linking repositories + reasoning systems | Continuous knowledge updates, auditable provenance |
| **Environment** | Regional groups hold distributed land-use and impact data | Federated RAG integrating local + regional knowledge | Informed policy with local voices visible |
