## Core Programs

Resonant Knowledge Lab advances ethical AI through five interconnected program areas:

### Ethical AI & Knowledge Stewardship

We develop and promote governance frameworks for AI systems that respect cultural, local, and institutional boundaries of data use.

**Objectives**:
- Publish the *RKL Code of Ethics for Knowledge Stewardship in AI*
- Lead workshops on data sovereignty, AI accountability, and ethical model design
- Collaborate with partner organizations to implement Model Context Protocol (MCP)-based data governance

**Example Projects**:
- **AI Governance Playbook** — a toolkit for nonprofits and small institutions adopting AI responsibly
- **Ethical AI Fellowship Program** — annual fellowship supporting emerging scholars and practitioners

### Local & Indigenous Knowledge Systems

We support communities in digitizing, archiving, and responsibly integrating traditional knowledge into AI systems without loss of ownership or cultural integrity.

**Objectives**:
- Establish partnerships with at least two Indigenous or local knowledge organizations by 2026
- Develop co-governed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with community oversight
- Provide training on digital archiving and data-sovereign AI design

**Example Projects**:
- **TEK Digital Stewardship Pilot** — creating a secure AI knowledge base rooted in traditional ecological knowledge
- **Community-Led Model Training Lab** — integrating oral histories and archival material into a protected LLM fine-tuning workflow

### Organizational Knowledge Resilience

We help nonprofits, academic institutions, and civic agencies design closed-context AI systems that preserve institutional memory while maintaining data security.

**Objectives**:
- Create an *Organizational RAG Framework* for secure internal knowledge access
- Partner with two mission-driven organizations to pilot closed-context AI systems by 2027
- Publish case studies demonstrating ethical and operational benefits

**Example Projects**:
- **Knowledge Resilience Audit Toolkit** — assessing organizational preparedness for ethical AI integration
- **Closed RAG Demonstrator** — a live system showing how local infrastructure can support secure AI retrieval

### Open Infrastructure & Secure Contexts

We build auditable, privacy-preserving architectures that allow communities and organizations to manage their own AI contexts transparently.

**Objectives**:
- Develop an open-source *Secure Context Protocol* for distributed AI retrieval
- Implement community-governed compute environments using affordable, energy-efficient hardware
- Publish technical documentation for reproducible, transparent deployments

**Example Projects**:
- **Distributed Context Pilot** — decentralized storage and access control for community AI data
- **MCP Infrastructure Guide** — a practical manual for ethical AI integration in local environments

### Public Education & Collaboration

We advance public understanding of ethical AI and knowledge stewardship through education, outreach, and collaborative research.

**Objectives**:
- Host annual *Resonant Symposium* on AI, data sovereignty, and cultural knowledge
- Publish open educational resources (OER) and online modules
- Offer internships and community labs for students and researchers

**Example Projects**:
- **Resonant Open School** — an online learning hub for ethical AI literacy
- **Community Data Commons** — an open repository of governance models and case studies
