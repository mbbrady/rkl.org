# Secure Co-Design Between Frontier AI and Human Knowledge

Open infrastructure enabling **enterprise-class AI reasoning systems** — like GPT and Claude — to work securely with curated, locally governed knowledge domains without exposing or transferring them.

## Open Protocols for Contextual AI
Apply and refine public-interest protocols like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for secure AI-knowledge interaction. We work with emerging standards that define how reasoning systems can interact securely and verifiably with governed knowledge domains—ensuring privacy, provenance, and organizational control.

## Reference Implementations & Toolkits
Build open-source adapters, audit logging, and reproducible on-premises stacks organizations can deploy. Our reference implementations provide working examples of secure AI integration that organizations can adapt, deploy, and audit for their own needs.

## Decision Support & Field Pilots
Partner with organizations to deploy real-world systems that bridge research and institutional knowledge. Through applied pilot projects, we validate our approaches in real contexts—from healthcare to municipal planning—demonstrating practical, secure AI integration.

## Governance & Stewardship Frameworks
Publish templates for consent, data licensing, and policy-based access control. We develop practical governance tools that help organizations define who can access what knowledge, under which conditions, and with what oversight.

## Research & Applied Inquiry
Study how human-machine reasoning can responsibly contribute to knowledge creation. Through research partnerships (including NSF-funded projects), we examine when and how AI-supported reasoning can enhance organizational learning and decision-making.

## Education & Public Engagement
Build capacity through workshops and training labs on ethical AI and knowledge governance. We provide hands-on education, from technical workshops to red/blue-team privacy exercises, helping organizations understand and implement responsible AI practices.
