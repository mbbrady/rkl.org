# Trusted Reasoning for Living Knowledge

Welcome to the **Resonant Knowledge Lab** — a Virginia-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit creating open infrastructure that enables reasoning systems like GPT and Claude to work with knowledge domains organizations choose to expose—without transferring or compromising sensitive information.

**We provide tools that help organizations select, curate, and govern which knowledge to make accessible to AI—from peer-reviewed research to institutional data—maintaining full agency over what is exposed and how it can be used.**

---

## The Challenge

As AI becomes embedded in every aspect of society, we face a critical question: **How do we ensure communities, organizations, and cultures maintain agency over their knowledge?**

Traditional AI development often extracts data without context, erodes local autonomy, and concentrates power in centralized systems. But it doesn't have to be this way.

---

## Our Approach

RKL envisions a world where every organization, practitioner, and community can reason with both the knowledge it holds and the most current, authoritative understanding in its field.

We provide **open, verifiable methods and reproducible infrastructure** that let large-scale reasoning systems and locally hosted models engage with curated, governed knowledge domains—using protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and policy-aware retrieval architectures (RAG+).

Organizations maintain full control: they select which knowledge domains to expose (peer-reviewed literature, institutional data, operational knowledge, community experience), how they can be accessed, and under what governance terms.

## What We Do

### [Open Protocols for Contextual AI](/programs#open-protocols)
We apply and refine public-interest protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) that define how reasoning systems interact securely with governed knowledge domains.

### [Reference Implementations & Toolkits](/programs#implementations)
We build open-source adapters, audit logging systems, and reproducible on-premises stacks that organizations can deploy to connect AI systems with their curated knowledge.

### [Decision Support & Knowledge Access Pilots](/programs#pilots)
We partner with organizations to deploy real-world systems that help clinicians, planners, researchers, and practitioners access both current research and institutional knowledge through natural-language interaction.

### [Governance & Stewardship Frameworks](/programs#governance)
We publish templates for consent, data licensing, and policy-based access control—helping organizations define who can access what knowledge under which conditions.

### [Research & Applied Inquiry](/programs#research)
Through research partnerships (e.g., NSF-funded projects), we study how human-machine reasoning can responsibly contribute to knowledge creation and organizational learning.

### [Education & Public Engagement](/programs#education)
We build capacity through workshops, curricula, and training labs that help organizations understand and implement ethical AI and knowledge governance.

## Our Guiding Principles

- **Context Over Content** – Models engage with knowledge context through controlled interfaces, not raw data transfer
- **Protocols Over Platforms** – The trust layer of AI must remain open, inspectable, and non-proprietary
- **Verification Over Assumption** – Privacy, provenance, and consent must be provable, not implied
- **Governance by Design** – Human and organizational governance are encoded in the architecture itself
- **Resonance Through Reuse** – Knowledge gains value when it can be rediscovered and applied across time
- **Education Through Implementation** – Each pilot functions as both research and training

---

## Year 1 Focus (2025-2026)

**MCP + Closed RAG Reference Stack:** Building and documenting a reproducible, privacy-preserving AI context environment using local compute—demonstrating "trust through protocol" in practice.

**Field Pilot:** Partnering with one organization (archive, clinic, or municipality) to deploy and validate the RKL stack in a real-world context, producing a public case study.

**Governance Toolkit v1:** Publishing templates for consent, data licensing, and policy-based access that bridge technical and institutional audiences.
