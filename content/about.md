## Mission

**Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL)** is a nonprofit research and development organization dedicated to advancing ethical, community-governed artificial intelligence.

We explore how local, indigenous, and organizational knowledge can be securely integrated into AI through transparent, auditable architectures that protect privacy, context, and data sovereignty.

**Our mission is to make human knowledge — in all its cultural, institutional, and environmental forms — discoverable, accessible, and securely interoperable with AI.**

## Vision

A world where communities and organizations maintain full agency over their knowledge while benefiting from the power of artificial intelligence.

RKL fosters trust, inclusivity, and long-term stewardship of collective knowledge through secure, distributed infrastructures and open protocols for contextual AI.

## Guiding Principles

- **Respect & Reciprocity**: Prioritize community and institutional autonomy
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Every system is open to audit and review
- **Security & Sovereignty**: Uphold ownership and consent in all knowledge use
- **Interoperability with Integrity**: Connect diverse data ethically
- **Resonance over Extraction**: Amplify and protect knowledge rather than exploit it

## About RKL

Established in 2025 as a Virginia-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Resonant Knowledge Lab bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and human knowledge systems. We work with communities, organizations, and researchers to build ethical AI infrastructure that respects data sovereignty and cultural context.
