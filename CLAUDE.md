- ✅ Custom home layout created (`layouts/index.html`)
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment pipeline configured

### In Progress ⏳
- ⏳ **DNS Configuration** - Need to add DNS records at domain registrar
- ⏳ **Enable GitHub Pages** - Ready to enable when site is polished
- ⏳ Contact page (needs creation)
- ⏳ Blog setup (future)

### Site Ready But NOT LIVE
The site is built and ready at the `gh-pages` branch, but **NOT publicly accessible** until you enable GitHub Pages in repository settings.

---

## Deployment Setup (GitHub Pages)

### Current Deployment Status
- **Pipeline**: ✅ Working (auto-deploys on push to `main`)
- **Built Site**: ✅ Available in `gh-pages` branch
- **Custom Domain**: ✅ Configured (`resonantknowledgelab.org`)
- **Public Site**: ❌ NOT live (GitHub Pages disabled)

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Location: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**What it does:**
1. Triggers on every push to `main` branch
2. Checks out code with submodules
3. Sets up Hugo (latest extended version)
4. Builds site with `hugo --minify`
5. Deploys to `gh-pages` branch

**Monitor workflow**: https://github.com/mbbrady/rkl.org/actions

### To Make Site Live (When Ready)

**Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to: https://github.com/mbbrady/rkl.org/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Choose branch: **gh-pages** / **/ (root)**
4. Custom domain should show: **resonantknowledgelab.org**
5. Check "Enforce HTTPS" (recommended)

**Step 2: Configure DNS at Domain Registrar**

For apex domain (`resonantknowledgelab.org`), add these **A records**:
```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

For www subdomain (optional), add **CNAME record**:
```
www.resonantknowledgelab.org → mbbrady.github.io
```

**Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation**
- DNS changes take 24-48 hours to propagate
- Check DNS status: `dig resonantknowledgelab.org`
- GitHub will auto-issue SSL certificate once DNS is configured

### To Take Site Down
1. Go to: https://github.com/mbbrady/rkl.org/settings/pages
2. Change "Source" to **"None"**
3. Site immediately goes offline
